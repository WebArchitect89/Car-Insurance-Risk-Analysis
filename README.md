## Overview

What if you could predict which insurance customers are 3x more likely to file a claim before they even do?

UK insurers lose millions annually due to:

* Inaccurate risk pricing based on incomplete data analysis
* Reactive claim management instead of predictive insights
* Fragmented customer data across multiple systems
* Manual reporting processes that delay critical decisions

 SOLUTION:

I developed a comprehensive SQL analytics framework using a complete UK car insurance, randomly generated, dataset (1,200+ customers, 1,500+ policies, 1,000+ claims):

* Advanced SQL queries for customer segmentation & risk profiling
* Claims pattern analysis identifying high-risk indicators
* Automated reporting dashboards for real-time insights
* Predicting Claim Likelihood by Segment Based on Historical Data

This project demonstrates ability to:
* Reduce claim costs through better risk assessment
* Improve customer retention via targeted pricing strategies
* Accelerate decision-making with automated SQL reporting
* Transform raw data into actionable business intelligence

## Business Task

Analyze customer behavior, policy performance, and claims patterns within the UK car insurance market to identify high-risk customers, optimize pricing strategies, and reduce overall claim costs through data-driven insights.


## Prepare

Dataset overview:

Randomly generated data using Juilius AI

- customers.csv - 1200 rows, 11 columns

  - Primary Key: customer_id

  - Contains: Customer demographics, contact info, driving history

- policies.csv - 1500 rows, 12 columns

  - Primary Key: policy_id

  - Foreign Key: customer_id (references customers.csv)

  - Contains: Policy details, vehicle info, coverage, premiums

- claims.csv - 1000 rows, 11 columns

  - Primary Key: claim_id

  - Foreign Key: policy_id (references policies.csv)

  - Foreign Key: customer_id (references customers.csv) 

  - Contains: Claim details, incident info, settlements


Relationships:

- One customer can have multiple policies (1:N)

- One policy can have multiple claims (1:N)

- Customers -> Policies -> Claims (hierarchical relationship)

## Process

- Removed any blanks.
- Removed duplicates.
- Ensured the data is in the right format.


## Analyze


Premiums and number of policies by age group.

```

#### CLAIMS AND PROFIT SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS

Total Claims Amount By Age Group.
Calculating what is the amount claimed by the age group, that information would be useful to inform the pricing strategy.
```
SELECT 
    -- Demographics
    CASE 
        WHEN c.age < 25 THEN 'Under 25'
        WHEN c.age BETWEEN 25 AND 39 THEN '25-39'
        WHEN c.age BETWEEN 40 AND 59 THEN '40-59'
        ELSE '60+'
    END AS age_group,
    c.gender,
    c.marital_status,
    c.occupation,
    
    -- Claims
    COUNT(cl.claim_id) AS claim_count,
    ROUND(SUM(cl.claim_amount), 2) AS total_claims_amount,
    ROUND(AVG(cl.claim_amount), 2) AS avg_claim_amount   
FROM customers c
JOIN claims cl 
    ON c.customer_id = cl.customer_id  
GROUP BY age_group, c.gender, c.marital_status, c.occupation
ORDER BY total_claims_amount DESC;
```

<img width="2748" height="1184" alt="Total Claims Amount By Age Group" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bcc4bf5-7d01-4a2c-a678-fced6ce3554c" />

This code segments the customers by demographics policy and vehicle details as well as claims details.
Also I have taken into account the average credit score and average years licensed.  
The query pulls the following info:


Breaks down the customers by segments such us:


- Demographics
 - Age group
 - Gender
 - Marital status
 - Occupation

- Policy and vehicle details such as:
 - Coverage 
 - Vehicle make

Aggregates by segments such as 

- Number of customers
- Average credit score 
- Average licensed years
- Average credit score
- Average premiums

I also enriched that with the information from the claims data set.
This allows us to create the following:

Average Claims per Customer by Age and Occupation

```
SELECT 
    -- Demographics
    CASE 
        WHEN c.age < 25 THEN 'Under 25'
        WHEN c.age BETWEEN 25 AND 39 THEN '25-39'

        ELSE '60+'

#### PROFITABILITY
Overall Profitability
Looking at the overall profitability of the data it looks that the data set is highly unprofitable.
```
SELECT
    SUM(p.annual_premium) AS total_premiums,
    SUM(COALESCE(cl.claim_amount,0)) AS total_claims,
    (SUM(p.annual_premium) - SUM(COALESCE(cl.claim_amount,0))) AS profit,
    ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(cl.claim_amount,0)) * 1.0 / NULLIF(SUM(p.annual_premium),0), 2) AS loss_ratio
FROM policies p
LEFT JOIN claims cl ON p.policy_id = cl.policy_id
LEFT JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id;

```

Profitability-Based Customer Profiles

Analysing further profiles ranked by profitability (e.g., average premium â€“ claims paid), so we can determine which segments are most valuable and focus on unprofitable segments to eradicate loss of revenue.
The analysis assumes that if the claim status is closed then the settlement amount will be taken into consideration otherwise the claim amount will be used.
